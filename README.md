# ChatIYP

**ChatIYP** enables natural language interaction with the [Internet Yellow Pages (IYP)](https://iyp.iijlab.net/). It offers a conversational interface‚Äîbuilt with Streamlit‚Äîallowing users to query structured internet infrastructure data using simple text.

## üîç What is ChatIYP?

ChatIYP is a natural language interface for the Internet Yellow Pages (IYP), allowing users to ask questions like:

> "Which ASes host root DNS servers?"

> "Show me IXPs in South America."

ChatIYP parses these queries, translates them into Cypher (the query language for Neo4j), and fetches the relevant results from IYP.

## üß† Powered by LlamaIndex

ChatIYP uses [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) to translate natural language questions into Cypher queries.  
**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** To support this functionality, a patch must be applied:

Replace the original LlamaIndex file:

```bash
llama_index/core/indices/property_graph/sub_retrievers/text_to_cypher.py
```

with the custom version located in:

```bash
patched/text_to_cypher.py
```

This step is critical for ChatIYP to function correctly.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

1. **Internet Yellow Pages (IYP)** must be installed and running locally. Follow the setup instructions here:  
   üëâ [IYP GitHub Repo](https://github.com/InternetHealthReport/internet-yellow-pages)

2. Python 3.8+ and dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

3. (Optional) Docker, if you prefer containerized deployment.
